Welcome to the Wordle Game implemented in Python! This project is a recreation of the popular 
word-guessing game, Wordle. The objective of the game is to guess the correct 5-letter word within 
six tries. After each guess, feedback is provided in the form of colored hints, which help the player 
identify which letters are correct and in the right position. To make it a bit easier, I had modified the
game to show the possible words after each guess
